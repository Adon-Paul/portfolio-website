## � Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Optional: Live Server extension in VS Code for hot reloads

### Run locally
```powershell
cd portfolio-website
start msedge index.html
```

Or, if you use the Live Server extension, right-click `index.html` and select **Open with Live Server** for auto-refreshing.

### Customize the template
1. **Update personal info**: Replace headings, stats, and contact details in `index.html`.
2. **Add project imagery**: Drop screenshots into `images/projects/` and update the `<div class="project-thumb">` placeholders.
3. **Tailor content**: Edit copy in the Services, Lab, Highlights, and Updates sections to match your story.
4. **Refresh metrics**: Adjust GitHub follower/repo counts and timeline dates as your profile evolves.
5. **Adjust styles**: Modify colors, gradients, and spacing in `css/style.css`. Layer additional tweaks in `css/responsive.css` for smaller screens.
6. **Enhance interactions**: Extend animations or scroll effects in `js/main.js` as you learn new patterns.
